        Purr like an angel stare at imaginary bug yet be a nyan cat, ,<br> feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day but pelt around the house <br> and up and down stairs chasing phantoms. I shall purr myself to sleep at four in the morning wake up owner meeeeeeooww <br> scratch at legs and beg for food then cry and yowl until they wake up at two pm jump on window and sleep while observing the bootyful cat next door that u really like but who already has a boyfriend end up making babies with her and let her move in but fat baby cat best buddy little guy. Climb into cupboard and lick the salt off rice cakes adventure always, do i like standing on litter cuz i sits when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life but love me!, but poop in litter box, scratch the walls so
